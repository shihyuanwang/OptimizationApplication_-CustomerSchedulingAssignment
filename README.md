# Optimization Application - Customer Scheduling / Assignment

To schedule family customers to Santa's Workshop in a way that minimizes the cost of the Workshop:

- An Amusement park is launching a new activity, Santa's Workshop tours, to increase customers’ willingness to come during the 100 days before Christmas.

- Because demand was so strong, and the park wanted to make things as fair as possible, they let each of the 5,000 families that will visit the workshop choose top 10 preferences for the dates they'd like to attend the workshop.

- Now that the park have received their preferences, they’ve realized it's impossible for every family to get their top picks, so they’ve decided to provide extra perks for families that don't get their preferences. 

- In addition, the park 's accounting department has evaluated that, depending on how families are scheduled, there may be some unexpected costs incurred.
